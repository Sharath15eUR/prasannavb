A default gateway is the router or device that connects your local network to other networks, including the internet. 
It acts as an exit point for traffic going outside your local network.

STEP 1:Find Your Default Gateway
    ip route | grep default
STEP 2:Check If the Default Gateway Is Reachable
    ping -c 5 192.168.29.1
    
    If replies are received, the gateway is reachable.
