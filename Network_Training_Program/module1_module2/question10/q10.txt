A DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network. Hereâ€™s how the process works:

Steps in DHCP IP Assignment:
1.DHCP Discovery:When a device (client) connects to the network, it broadcasts a request (DHCPDISCOVER) to find a DHCP server.
2.DHCP Offer:The DHCP server responds with a DHCPOFFER, offering an available IP address along with other network settings (subnet mask, gateway, DNS).
3.DHCP Request:The client accepts the offer by sending a DHCPREQUEST, requesting to use the provided IP address.
4.DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK):The DHCP server confirms the assignment by sending a DHCPACK, and the client starts using the assigned IP.
