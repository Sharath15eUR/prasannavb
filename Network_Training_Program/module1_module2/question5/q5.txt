If two nodes are assigned the same IP address in a network, it creates conflicts, especially in Layer 2 (L2) devices like switches that rely on MAC tables for forwarding packets.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Issues:
    Since multiple devices have the same IP, ARP struggles to map a unique MAC address to that IP.
    If only one node is active at a time, the MAC table keeps updating with whichever device last responded, allowing temporary communication.
    If both nodes communicate simultaneously, the network behaves unpredictably:
        The node with more active connections or existing ARP cache entries may dominate.
        Both nodes may respond to ARP requests, causing MAC table instability and packet loss.
        If the collision persists, neither device receives packets correctly, making both unreachable.

DHCP and Static IP Conflicts:
    If a DHCP server is managing IP allocation, it detects the conflict and assigns a unique IP to one of the devices.
    In statically assigned IP networks, manual intervention is required to resolve the conflict
