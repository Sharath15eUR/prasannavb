The given IP addresses are 

-  192.168.10.5  — A  Class C  IP address with a  /24  subnet mask.  
-  172.20.15.1  — A  Class B  IP address with a  /16  subnet mask.  
-  8.8.8.8  — A  Class A  IP address with a  /8  subnet mask, which is the well-known  Google DNS server .  

These classifications are based on the classful addressing scheme.


Network Address Translation (NAT): 
 NAT  is commonly used to convert  private IP addresses  into  public IP addresses  to facilitate internet communication. This process can be implemented using one of the following methods:  

1.  Static NAT (One-to-One Mapping):  Each private IP is mapped to a specific public IP.  
2.  Dynamic NAT (Pool Mapping):  A pool of public IP addresses is assigned dynamically to internal private IPs.  
3.  PAT (Port Address Translation / Many-to-One Mapping):  Multiple private IP addresses share a  single public IP , with unique port numbers distinguishing individual connections.  

How NAT Translates Traffic 
-  Outbound Traffic (Private → Public):   
  When a device from the internal network sends data to the internet, the NAT-enabled router (or NAT-compatible device) modifies the  source IP  in the outgoing packet to a  public IP  based on the configured NAT rules.  

-  Inbound Traffic (Public → Private):   
  When a response or incoming packet arrives, its  destination IP  will be the public IP assigned by NAT. The NAT device then performs a reverse translation, mapping it back to the corresponding  private IP  in the internal network using its configured rules.

This bidirectional translation ensures proper routing between private networks and external public networks.
