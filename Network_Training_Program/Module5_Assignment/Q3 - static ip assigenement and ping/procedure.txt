Steps:
Log in to your router’s web interface.
Go to the DHCP settings or IP reservation section.
Find the device’s MAC address in the list of connected devices (or manually enter it).
Assign a specific IP address within the DHCP range to that MAC address.
Save the settings; the router will now reserve this IP for the device whenever it connects.
